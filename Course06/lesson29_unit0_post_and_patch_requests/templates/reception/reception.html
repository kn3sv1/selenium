        <h2>Clinic founded in %FOUNDED_YEAR% year</h2>
        <p>
        Pantazis Clinic was founded in %FOUNDED_YEAR% by %NAME% and it initially operated strictly as a gynecological
        â€“ obstetric clinic. Our primary concern always was to provide health services that meet the needs of women in
        general and pregnant women in particular. Our goal is to provide high quality services in modern women and quality
        care to expectant mothers. Our services cover a wide spectrum of both gynecological â€“ obstetric services and infertility
        and plastic surgery operations and services.
